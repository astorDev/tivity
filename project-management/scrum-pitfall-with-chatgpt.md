# Talking Scrum Main Pitfall with ChatGPT

During my career, I've been founding myself in a team that tries to practice Scrum to a certain degree quite a lot of time. Each team has its own set of challenges, open questions and discussed answers. One particular topic, however, kept appearing in every team. Finally, I've decided to express my thoughts on it in an article. Discouragingly, I couldn't come up with a proper structure and exact points I want to make. How would ChatGPT structure that? I asked myself. So, this was the prompt I gave it:

## The Overlooked Aspect

I would give it a harsher name.

## No Time for Grooming

This title is too soft, too. Time for grooming is not just insufficient it is simply not existing.

## Abandoning Decomposition

This title is right on point. And the points are exactly correct, too. However, they suffer from being too soft, again. Teams not **may**, but **will** struggle to provide accurate estimates. Poorly decomposed tasks **will** result in ~~integration~~ challenges. And it **will** impact code quality.

## Lack Of Accountability

I'm not sure it needs explaining, that neither Scrum Master nor Product Owner can provide a proper technical decomposition. So, I'll erase that and focus on "Developers". Switching developer's focus on decomposition is indeed a problem. However, I don't think it is **the** problem. The real issue, in my mind, is accountability. My belief is that **group accountability** is a bad idea in the first place. I'm afraid that is a big philosophical discussion on its own. So let me just highlight that and move on.

## The coda

In the conclusion ChatGPT goes bootlicking Scrum and leaves organizing proper planning on the organization's shoulder. In my view, the problem is indirect consequence of Scrum itself with its utopian vision for Sprint planning. I would even argue this things make the "as-is Scrum" impractical. So my advice would be to put discussion of how do proper decomposition prior to organizing a "Scrum".
