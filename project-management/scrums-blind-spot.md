# Scrum's Main Blind Spot

I have a mixed emotions about Scrum. I felt extreme enthusiasm when I first learnt about it. When I've read "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" I was ready to mark it as a best non-fiction book I've ever read. But then the reality came in. In the last years, every development team I've been a part of claimed to be practicing Scrum. Yet, virtually every Scrum event I've witnessed was ridiculously different from what I expected.

Well, blaming that on people gives me the "this is not a real communism" vibes. However, criticizing a methodology for something that is not part of it or even contradicts it seems like strawmanning. There is one thing though, that the actual Scrum guide approaches inadequately, in my taste.

## In a nutshell

Scrum provides a surprisingly utopian picture of sprint planning, where in a single session from the ground up team decides on a sprint goal, backlog items and even on how to implement them. This vision, seasoned with no hierarchy among developers principle, is in a conflict with my belief that adequate decomposition takes immense competence and significant amount of time. Therefore, I would advocate for redefining approach to planning and possibly even introducing a new scrum role. Team Lead? Architect?
